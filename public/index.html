        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Karthik Sankar</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Karthik Sankar, often seen with the psudonym <em>Kihtrak Raknas</em> is a resident in New Jersey. He is currently a senior at South Brunswick High School (or <em>SBHS</em> for short).<br><br> Karthik loves to program. He also loves to make things. Two things that conveniently happen to complement each other quite well. He especially loves to code in JavaScript (React, React Native, Node.js, etc), Java (Android apps, server side code), Python (ML, server side code) and C++ (robotics code).<br><br> He loves to volenteer at the South Brunswick Public library (SBPL) where he runs a robotics club and a <em>Maker</em> club. He has a massed over 270 volenteer hours at SBPL. <br><br> At the high school I am an active member of the Computer Science Club and a cross country runner. In addition, I am the captain of a robotics team at my school: <a href="http://750s.github.io">750S</a>. </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Yes, Karthik did write this whole thing in third person. Does he know why he wrote in third person? No. Is he going to do anything about it? No.</p>
